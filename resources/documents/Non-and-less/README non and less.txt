README file for prefix non/non- and suffix -less

--> Our corpora from all the 2015 blogs, cochrane and PubMed were analysed for both suffixes and prefixes and the following was found:

I. PREFIX NON/NON-

13,564 tokens of non/non- were found:

No hyphen:4,215
hyphen: 9,349

There were a total of 2,294 forms.

From a visual inspection it is clear that there is no conflict of meaning whatsoever. The particle in all cases shows the negation of the lexeme, which can be simplified to: not + word, e.g.. Nonfatal --> Not fatal.

SUFFIX LESS

1,392 instances. Note that -less = without + word, thus it is not exactly the same as saying prefix + word (such as impossible = not possible). "Endless" would have to be something like:

 endless = without an end.

For double negations,s sentence such as:

"The pain is not endless."

would have to be simplified as: 

"The pain has an end."

There are some contrary examples, which makes me think that a list for the suffix could be a better approach:

Unless, Needless, countless ,nonetheless

Since the list of exceptions was short, I built a list for them (which means that these words should NOT be simplified):
