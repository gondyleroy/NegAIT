Anaplasmosis is a disease caused by a rickettsial parasite of ruminants, Anaplasma spp.
The organism occurs in the erythrocytes and is transmitted by natural means through by a number of haematophagous species of ticks and flies. It can also be transmitted iatrogenically by the use of surgical, dehorning, castration, and tattoo instruments and hypodermic needles that are not disinfected between uses. 
The organism can go through a complete lifecycle in the gut of certain species of ticks but the flies appear to be only a mechanical vector, thus, not as important in the maintaining the disease in any given area. 
The disease causes severe anemia and wasting in adult cattle which are infected. 
Young cattle and most other ruminants will not show clinical signs if infected but may serve as carriers. 
Since the organism hides from the body's immune system in red blood cells, it is difficult if not impossible for an infection to be totally cleared. 
As the immune response wanes, the organism again builds up and the host relapses. 
In the United States, anaplasmosis is notably present in the south and west where the tick hosts Dermacentor spp. are found.
Although vaccines have been developed, none are currently available in the United States. 
Apraxia is a motor disorder caused by damage to the brain (specifically the posterior parietal cortex), in which someone has difficulty with the motor planning to perform tasks or movements when asked, provided that the request or command is understood and he/she is willing to perform the task.
A person with apraxia cannot move his or her lips or tongue to the right place to say sounds correctly because, even though the muscles are not weak, the messages from the brain to the mouth are disrupted.
The nature of the brain damage determines the severity.
Apraxia is an acquired disorder of motor planning, but is not caused by incoordination, sensory loss, or failure to comprehend simple commands (which can be tested by asking the person to recognize the correct movement from a series).
It is caused by damage to specific areas of the cerebrum.
Apraxia should not be confused with ataxia, a lack of coordination of movements; aphasia, an inability to produce and/or comprehend language; abulia, the lack of desire to carry out an action; or allochiria, in which patients perceive stimuli to one side of the body as occurring on the other.
Developmental coordination disorder is the developmental disorder of motor planning.
There are several types of apraxia including: Each type may be tested at decreasing levels of complexity; if the person tested fails to execute the commands, you can make the movement yourself and ask that the person mimic it, or you can even give them a real object (like a toothbrush) and ask them to use it.
Apraxia of speech (AOS) is a neurologic speech disorder that reflects an impaired capacity to plan or program sensorimotor commands necessary for directing movements that result in phonetically and prosodically normal speech.
It occurs in both children (childhood apraxia of speech) and adults (acquired apraxia of speech) who have (prior to the onset of apraxia) acquired some level of speaking ability.
Beriberi refers to a cluster of symptoms caused primarily by a nutritional deficit in vitamin B1 (thiamine). 
Beriberi has conventionally been divided into three separate entities, relating to the body system mainly involved (peripheral nervous system or cardiovascular) or age of person (like infantile).
Beriberi is one of several thiamine-deficiency related conditions, which may occur concurrently, including Wernicke's encephalopathy (mainly affecting the central nervous system), Korsakoff's syndrome (amnesia with additional psychiatric manifestations), and Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome (with both neurologic and psychiatric symptoms).
Historically, beriberi has been common in regions where what is variously referred to as polished or white rice forms a major part of the diet, which has its husk removed to extend its shelf life and palatability but has the side effect of removing the primary source of thiamine.It was not known until the end of the 19th century that polishing rice was associated with beriberi. 
Symptoms of beriberi include weight loss, emotional disturbances, impaired sensory perception, weakness and pain in the limbs, and periods of irregular heart rate. 
Edema (swelling of bodily tissues) is common. 
It may increase the amount of lactic acid and pyruvic acid within the blood. 
In advanced cases, the disease may cause high-output cardiac failure and death. 
Symptoms may occur concurrently with those of Wernicke's encephalopathy, a primarily neurological thiamine-deficiency related condition. 
Beriberi is divided into three historical classifications, a fourth form, gastrointestinal beriberi, was recognized in 2004: Dry beriberi causes wasting and partial paralysis resulting from damaged peripheral nerves. 
An abscess (Latin: abscessus) is a collection of pus that has built up within the tissue of the body.
Signs and symptoms of abscesses include redness, pain, warmth, and swelling.
The swelling may feel fluid filled when pressed.
The area of redness often extends beyond the swelling.
Carbuncles and boils are types of abscess that often involve hair follicles with carbuncles being larger.
They are usually caused by a bacterial infection.
Often many different types of bacteria are involved in a single infection.
In the United States and many other areas of the world the most common bacteria present is methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
Rarely, parasites can cause abscesses and this is more common in the developing world.
Bubonic plague is one of three types of bacterial infection caused by Yersinia pestis.
Three to seven days after exposure to the bacteria flu like symptoms develop.
This includes fever, headaches, and vomiting.
Swollen and painful lymph nodes occur in the area closest to where the bacteria entered the skin.
Occasionally the swollen lymph nodes may break open.
The three types of plague are the result of the route of infection: bubonic plague, septicemic plague, and pneumonic plague.
Bubonic plague is mainly spread by infected fleas from small animals.
It may also result from exposure to the body fluids from a dead plague infected animal.
In the bubonic form of plague, the bacteria enter through the skin through a flea bite and travel via the lymphatic vessels to a lymph node, causing it to swell.
Diagnosis is by finding the bacteria in the blood, sputum, or fluid from lymph nodes.
Cerebral palsy (CP) is a group of permanent movement disorders that appear in early childhood.
Signs and symptoms vary between people.
Often, symptoms include poor coordination, stiff muscles, weak muscles, and tremors.
There may be problems with sensation, vision, hearing, swallowing, and speaking.
Often babies with cerebral palsy do not roll over, sit, crawl, or walk as early as other children their age.
Difficulty with the ability to think or reason and seizures each occurs in about one third of people with CP.
While the symptoms may get more noticeable over the first few years of life, the underlying problems do not worsen over time.
cerebral palsy is caused by abnormal development or damage to the parts of the brain that control movement, balance, and posture.
Most often the problems occur during pregnancy; however, they may also occur during childbirth, or shortly after birth.
Often the cause is unknown.
Chagas disease, also known as American trypanosomiasis, is a tropical parasitic disease caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi.
It is spread mostly by insects known as Triatominae or kissing bugs.
The symptoms change over the course of the infection.
In the early stage, symptoms are typically either not present or mild, and may include fever, swollen lymph nodes, headaches, or local swelling at the site of the bite.
After 8–12 weeks, individuals enter the chronic phase of disease and in 60–70% it never produces further symptoms.
The other 30 to 40% of people develop further symptoms 10 to 30 years after the initial infection, including enlargement of the ventricles of the heart in 20 to 30%, leading to heart failure.
An enlarged esophagus or an enlarged colon may also occur in 10% of people.
T. cruzi is commonly spread to humans and other mammals by the blood-sucking kissing bugs of the subfamily Triatominae.
These insects are known by a number of local names, including: vinchuca in Argentina, Bolivia, Chile and Paraguay, barbeiro (the barber) in Brazil, pito in Colombia, chinche in Central America, and chipo in Venezuela.
The disease may also be spread through blood transfusion, organ transplantation, eating food contaminated with the parasites, and by vertical transmission (from a mother to her fetus).
Coronavirus is a genus of animal virus belonging to the family Coronaviridae.Coronaviruses are enveloped viruses with a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome and a helical symmetry.
The genomic size of coronaviruses ranges from approximately 16 to 31 kilobases, extraordinarily large for an RNA virus.
The name coronavirus is derived from the greek ÎºÎ¿Ï?ÏŽÎ½Î±, meaning crown, as the virus envelope appears under electron microscopy (E.M.) to be crowned by a characteristic ring of small bulbous structures.
This morphology is actually formed by the viral spike (S) peplomers, which are proteins that populate the surface of the virus and determine host tropism.
Coronaviruses are grouped in the order Nidovirales, named for the Latin nidus, meaning nest, as all viruses in this order produce a 3' co-terminal nested set of subgenomic mRNA's during infection.
Proteins that contribute to the overall structure of all coronaviruses are the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N).
In the specific case of SARS (see below), a defined receptor-binding domain on S mediates the attachment of the virus to its cellular receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).
Members of the group 2 coronaviruses also have a shorter spike-like protein called hemagglutinin esterase (HE) encoded in their genome, but for some reason this protein is not always brought to expression (produced) in the cell.
Diseases of coronavirus Coronaviruses primarily infect the upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tract of mammals and birds.
Four to five different currently known strains of coronaviruses infect humans.
Corynebacterium diphtheriae is a pathogenic bacterium that causes diphtheria.
It is also known as the Klebs-Löffler bacillus, because it was discovered in 1884 by German bacteriologists Edwin Klebs (1834 – 1912) and Friedrich Löffler (1852 – 1915).
Morphology and toxin production C. diphtheriae is a facultatively aerobic Gram positive organism, characterized by non-encapsulated, non-sporulated, immobile, straight or curved rods with a length of 1 to 8 µm and width of 0.3 to 0.8 µm, which form ramified aggregations in culture (looking like Chinese characters).
The bacterium may contain polymetaphosphate aggregates called Volutin granules.
It is pathogenic only in humans.
C. diphtheriae produce diphtheria toxin, a proteic exotoxin, with a molecular weight of 62 kilodaltons which ADP-ribosylates host EF-2, resulting in the inhibition of protein synthesis and thus is responsible for the signs of diphtheria.
The inactivation of this toxin with an antitoxic serum (antitoxin) is the basis of the antidiphtheric therapeutic vaccination.
However, not all strains are toxigenic; the ability to produce the exotoxin is conferred on the bacterium when it is infected by a bacteriophage (a mechanism termed lysogenic activation).
A non-toxigenic strain can thus become toxigenic by the infection of such a bacteriophage.
The four subspecies differ slightly in their colonial morphology and biochemical properties such as the ability to metabolize certain nutrients, but all may be toxigenic (and therefore cause diphtheria) or non-toxigenic.
Dent's disease (or Dent disease) is a rare X-linked recessive inherited condition that affects the proximal renal tubulesof the kidney.
It is one cause of Fanconi syndrome, and is characterized by tubular proteinuria, excess calcium in the urine, formation of calcium kidney stones, nephrocalcinosis, and chronic kidney failure.
Dent's disease is often used to describe an entire group of familial disorders, including X-linked recessive nephrolithiasis with kidney failure, X-linked recessive hypophosphatemic rickets, and both Japanese and idiopathic low-molecular-weight proteinuria.
About 60% of patients have mutations in the CLCN5 gene (Dent 1), which encodes a kidney-specific chloride/proton antiporter, and 15% of patients have mutations in the OCRL1 gene (Dent 2).
Signs and symptomsDent's disease often produces the following signs and symptoms: In a study of 25 patients with Dent's disease,9 of 15 men, and one of 10 women suffered end-stage kidney disease by the age of 47.
GeneticsDent's disease is a X-linked recessive disorder.
The males are prone to manifesting symptoms in early adulthood with symptoms of calculi, rickets or even with kidney failure in more severe cases.
In humans, gene CLCN5 is located on chromosome Xp11.22, and has a 2238-bp coding sequence that consists of 11 exons that span 25 to 30 kb of genomic DNA and encode a 746-amino-acid protein.
CLCN5 belongs to the family of voltage-gated chloride channel genes (CLCN1-CLCN7, CLCKa and CLCKb) that have about 12 transmembrane domains.
These chloride channels have an important role in the control of membrane excitability, transepithelial transport, and possibly cell volume.
Desmoplastic small-round-cell tumor is an aggressive and rare cancer that primarily occurs as masses in the abdomen.Other areas affected may include the lymph nodes, the lining of the abdomen, diaphragm, spleen, liver, chest wall, skull, spinal cord, large intestine, small intestine, bladder, brain, lungs, testicles, ovaries, and the pelvis.
Reported sites of metatastic spread include the liver, lungs, lymph nodes, brain, skull, and bones.
The tumor is classified as a soft tissue sarcoma.
It is considered a childhood cancer that predominantly strikes boys and young adults.
The disease rarely occurs in females, but when it does the tumors can be mistaken for ovarian cancer.
In dogs, mast cell tumors are the most frequent round cell tumor.
There are no known risk factors that have been identified specific to the disease.
The tumor appears to arise from the primitive cells of childhood, and is considered a childhood cancer.
Research has indicated that there is a chimeric relationship between desmoplastic small-round-cell tumor (DSRCT) and Wilms' tumor and Ewing's sarcoma.
Together with neuroblastoma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, they form the small cell tumors.
DSRCT is associated with a unique chromosomal translocation t(11;22)(p13:q12)resulting in an EWS/WT1 transcriptthat is diagnostic of this tumor.
Fasciolopsiasis results from infection by the trematode Fasciolopsis buski (Lankester, 1857) Odhner, 1902, the largest intestinal fluke of humans (up to 7.5 cm in length).
Geographic distribution This disease occurs in Asia and the Indian subcontinent, especially in areas where humans raise pigs and consume raw aquatic plants.
Infection cycle The parasite infects an amphibic snail (Segmentina nitidella, Segmentina hemisphaerula, Hippeutis schmackerie, Gyraulus, Lymnaea, Pila, Planorbis (Indoplanorbis)) after being released by infected feces; from this intermediate host metacercaria infest on aquatic plants, which are eaten (raw) by pigs and humans.
Also the water is possibly infective when drunk unheated (Encysted cercariae exist not only on aquatic plants, but also on the surface of the water.)
Most infections are light and asymptomatic.
In heavier infections, symptoms include diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever, ascites, anasarca, and intestinal obstruction.
Laboratory diagnosis Microscopic identification of eggs, or more rarely of the adult flukes, in the stool or vomitus is the basis of specific diagnosis.
The eggs are indistinguishable from those of Fasciola hepatica.
Triclabendazole is the drug of choice for treatment of fasciolopsiasis.
Hepatitis B is an infectious disease caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV) which affects the liver.
It can cause both acute and chronic infections.
Many people have no symptoms during the initial infection.
Some develop a rapid onset of sickness with vomiting, yellowish skin, tiredness, dark urine and abdominal pain.
Often these symptoms last a few weeks and rarely does the initial infection result in death.
It may take 30 to 180 days for symptoms to begin.
In those who get infected around the time of birth 90% develop chronic hepatitis B while less than 10% of those infected after the age of five do.
Most of those with chronic disease have no symptoms; however, cirrhosis and liver cancer may eventually develop.
These complications result in the death of 15 to 25% of those with chronic disease.
The virus is transmitted by exposure to infectious blood or body fluids.
Infection around the time of birth or from contact with other people's blood during childhood is the most frequent method by which hepatitis B is acquired in areas where the disease is common.
Hypothermia is a condition in which an organism's temperature drops below that required for normal metabolism and bodily functions.
In warm-blooded animals, core body temperature is maintained near a constant level through biologic homeostasis.
But when the body is exposed to cold its internal mechanisms may be unable to replenish the heat that is being lost to the organism's surroundings.
Hypothermia is the opposite of hyperthermia, the condition which causes heat exhaustion and heat stroke.
Symptoms Normal body temperature in humans is 98.6°F.
Hypothermia can be divided in three stages of severity.
In stage 1, body temperature drops by 1-2°C below normal temperature (1.8-3.6°F).
Mild to strong shivering occurs.
The victim is unable to perform complex tasks with the hands; the hands become numb.
Blood vessels in the outer extremities constrict, lessening heat loss to the outside air.
Breathing becomes quick and shallow.
Infertility is the inability of a person, animal or plant to reproduce by natural means.
It is usually not the natural state of a healthy adult organism, except notably among certain eusocial species (mostly haplodiploid insects).
In humans, infertility may describe a woman who is unable to conceive as well as being unable to carry a pregnancy to full term.
There are many biological and other causes of infertility, including some that medical intervention can treat.
Estimates from 1997 suggest that worldwide between three and seven per cent of all couples or women have an unresolved problem of infertility.
Many more couples, however, experience involuntary childlessness for at least one year: estimates range from 12% to 28%. 
20-30% of infertility cases are due to male infertility, 20-35% are due to female infertility, and 25-40% are due to combined problems in both parts.
In 10-20% of cases, no cause is found.
The most common cause of female infertility is ovulatory problems which generally manifest themselves by sparse or absent menstrual periods.
Male infertility is most commonly due to deficiencies in the semen, and semen quality is used as a surrogate measure of male fecundity.
A keloid (/ËˆkiË?lÉ”Éªd/; also keloidal scar) is the formation of a type of scar which, depending on its maturity, is composed mainly of either type III (early) or type I (late) collagen.
It is a result of an overgrowth of granulation tissue (collagen type 3) at the site of a healed skin injury which is then slowly replaced by collagen type 1.
Keloids are firm, rubbery lesions or shiny, fibrous nodules, and can vary from pink to the colour of the patient's flesh or red to dark brown in color.
A keloid scar is benign and not contagious, but sometimes accompanied by severe itchiness, pain,and changes in texture.
In severe cases, it can affect movement of skin.
Keloid scars are seen 15 times more frequently in people of African decent than in people of European decent.
Keloids should not be confused with hypertrophic scars, which are raised scars that do not grow beyond the boundaries of the original wound.
Signs and symptomsKeloids expand in claw-like growths over normal skin.
They have the capability to hurt with a needle-like pain or to itch, although the degree of sensation varies from person to person.
If the keloid becomes infected, it may ulcerate.
Keratitis is a condition in which the eye's cornea, the front part of the eye, becomes inflamed. The condition is often marked by moderate to intense pain and usually involves impaired eye sight.
Types Superficial keratitis involves the superficial layers of the cornea.
After healing, this form of keratitis does not generally leave a scar.
Deep keratitis involves deeper layers of the cornea, leaving a scar upon healing that impairs vision if on or near the visual axis.
Causes Keratitis has multiple causes, one of which is an infection of a present or previous herpes simplex virus secondary to an upper respiratory infection, involving cold sores.
The symptoms are often very similar to those of conjunctivitis, an inflammation of the conjunctiva, and photophobia.
The eye turns very red and there may be sensitivity to light, and the eye may feel uncomfortable.
In the later stages of more severe cases, there can be strong pain, loss of vision/blurriness, and pus may form.
Effective diagnosis is important in detecting this condition and subsequent treatment as keratitis is sometimes mistaken for an allergic conjunctivitis.
Treatment depends on the cause of the keratitis Infectious keratitis generally requires antibacterial, antifungal, or antiviral therapy is to treat the infection.
Many diseases of the liver are accompanied by jaundice caused by increased levels of bilirubin in the system.
The bilirubin results from the breakup of the hemoglobin of dead red blood cells; normally, the liver removes bilirubin from the blood and excretes it through bile.
There are also many pediatric liver disease, including biliary atresia, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, alagille syndrome, and progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis, to name but a few.
A number of liver function tests are available to test the proper function of the liver.
These test for the presence of enzymes in blood that are normally most abundant in liver tissue, metabolites or products.
The external signs include a coated tongue, bad breath, skin rashes, itchy skin, excessive sweating, offensive body odour, dark circles under the eyes, red swollen and itchy eyes, acne rosacea, brownish spots and blemishes on the skin, flushed facial appearance or excessive facial blood vessels.
Other symptoms include jaundice, dark urine, pale stool, bone loss, easy bleeding, itching, small, spider-like blood vessels visible in the skin, enlarged spleen, fluid in the abdominal cavity, chills, pain from the biliary tract or pancrea, and an enlarged gallbladder.
The symptoms related to liver dysfunction include both physical signs and a variety of symptoms related to digestive problems, blood sugar problems, immune disorders, abnormal absorption of fats, and metabolism problems.
The malabsorption of fats may lead to symptoms that include indigestion, reflux, hemorhoids, gall stones, intolerance to fatty foods, intolerance to alcohol, nausea and vomiting attacks, abdominal bloating, and constipation.
Nervous system disorders include depression, mood changes, especially anger and irritability, poor concentration and foggy brain, overheating of the body, especially the face and torso, and recurrent headaches (including migraine) associated with nausea.
Mental retardation is a triarchic disorder, characterized by subaverage cognitive functioning and deficits in two or more adaptive behaviors with onset before the age of 18.
Once focused almost entirely on cognition, the definition now includes both a component relating to mental functioning and one relating to the individual's functional skills in their environment.
Alternative terms The term mental retardation is a diagnostic term designed to capture and standardize a group of disconnected categories of mental functioning such as idiot, imbecile, and moron derived from early IQ tests, which acquired pejorative connotations in popular discourse over time.
The term mental retardation has itself now acquired some pejorative and shameful connotations over the last few decades due to the use of retarded as an insult among younger people.
This may in turn have contributed to its replacement with expressions such as mentally challenged or intellectual disability.
The American Association on Mental Retardation continued to use the term mental retardation until 2006.
In June 2006 its members voted to change the name of the organization to the American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities, rejecting the options to become the AAID or AADD.
Part of the rationale for the double name was that many members worked with people with pervasive developmental disorders, most of whom are not mentally retarded.
In the UK, mental handicap had become the common medical term, replacing mental subnormality in Scotland and mental deficiency in England and Wales, until Stephen Dorrell, Secretary of State for Health in England and Wales from 1995-7, changed the NHS's designation to learning disability.
The new term is not yet widely understood, and is often taken to refer to problems affecting schoolwork (the American usage): which are known in the UK as learning difficulties.
Osteomalacia is the softening of the bones caused by impaired bone metabolism primarily due to inadequate levels of available phosphate, calcium, and vitamin D, or because of resorption of calcium.
The impairment of bone metabolism causes inadequate bone remineralization.
Osteomalacia in children is known as rickets, and because of this, use of the term osteomalacia is often restricted to the milder, adult form of the disease.
Signs and symptoms can include diffuse body pains, muscle weakness, and fragility of the bones.
The most common cause of osteomalacia is a deficiency of vitamin D, which is normally derived from sunlight exposure and, to a lesser extent, from the diet.
The most specific screening test for vitamin D deficiency in otherwise healthy individuals is a serum 25(OH)D level.
Less common causes of osteomalacia can include hereditary deficiencies of vitamin D or phosphate (which would typically be identified in childhood) or malignancy.
Measures to prevent and treat osteomalacia usually revolve around intake of vitamin D and calcium supplements.
Vitamin D should always be administered in conjunction with calcium supplementation since most of the consequences of vitamin D deficiency are a result of impaired mineral ion homeostasis.
Nursing home residents and the homebound elderly population are at particular risk for vitamin D deficiency, as these populations typically receive little sun exposure.
Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PanNETs, PETs, or PNETs), often referred to as islet cell tumors,or pancreatic endocrine tumorsare neuroendocrine neoplasms that arise from cells of the endocrine (hormonal) and nervous system within the pancreas.
PanNETs are a type of neuroendocrine tumor, representing about one third of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs).
Many PanNETs are benign, while some are malignant.
Aggressive PanNET tumors have traditionally been termed islet cell carcinoma.
PanNETs are quite distinct from the usual form of pancreatic cancer, the majority of which are adenocarcinomas, which arises in the exocrine pancreas.
Only 1 or 2% of clinically significant pancreas neoplasms are PanNETs.
PanNETs are sometimes abbreviated as PETs or PNETs: such use should not to be confused with the primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET).
The majority of PanNETs are benign, while some are malignant.
The World Health Organization (WHO) classification scheme places neuroendocrine tumors into three main categories, which emphasize the tumor grade rather than the anatomical origin.
In practice, those tumors termed well or intermediately differentiated PanNETs in the WHO scheme are sometimes called islet cell tumors.
Paratyphoid fever, also known simply as paratyphoid, is a bacterial infection caused by one of the three types of Salmonella enterica.
Symptoms usually begin six to thirty days after exposure and are the same as those of typhoid fever.
Often there is a gradual onset of a high fever over several days.
Weakness, loss of appetite, and headaches also commonly occur.
Some people develop a skin rash with rose colored spots.
Without treatment symptoms may last weeks or months.
Other people may carry the bacteria without being affected; however, are still able to spread the disease to others.
Both typhoid and paratyphoid are of similar severity.
Paratyphoid fever is a type of enteric fever along with typhoid fever.
Paratyphoid is caused by the bacteria Salmonella enterica of the serotype Paratyphi A, Paratyphi B or Paratyphi C growing in the intestines and blood.
Psittacosis — also known as parrot fever, and ornithosis — is a zoonotic infectious disease caused by a bacterium called Chlamydophila psittaci and contracted from infected parrots, such as macaws, cockatiels and budgerigars, and pigeons, sparrows, ducks, hens, gulls and many other species of bird.
The incidence of infection in canaries and finches is believed to be lower than in psittacine birds.
In certain contexts, the word psittacosis is used when the disease is carried by any species of bird belonging to the Psittacidae family, whereas ornithosis is used when other birds carry the disease.
In humansIn humans, after an incubation period of 5–19 days, the symptoms of the disease range from inapparent illness to systemic illness with severe pneumonia.
It presents chiefly as an atypical pneumonia.
In the first week of psittacosis the symptoms mimic typhoid fever: prostrating high fevers, joint pains, diarrhea, conjunctivitis, nose bleeds and low level of white blood cells in the blood.
Rose spots can appear and these are called Horder's spots.
Spleen enlargement is common towards the end of the first week.
Diagnosis can be suspected in case of respiratory infection associated with splenomegaly and/or epistaxis.
Headache can be so severe that it suggests meningitis and some nuchal rigidity is not unusual.
A rash is a change of the skin which affects its color, appearance, or texture.
A rash may be localized in one part of the body, or affect all the skin.
Rashes may cause the skin to change color, itch, become warm, bumpy, dry, cracked or blistered, swell and may be painful.
The causes, and therefore treatments for rashes, vary widely.
Diagnosis must take into account such things as the appearance of the rash, other symptoms, what the patient may have been exposed to, occupation, and occurrence in family members.
The diagnosis may confirm any number of conditions.
The presence of a rash may aid associated signs and symptoms are diagnostic of certain diseases.
For example, the rash in measles is an erythematous, maculopapular rash that begins a few days after the fever starts; it classically starts at the head and spreads downwards.
Common causes of rashes include: Uncommon causes:  Evaluating a rash The causes of a rash are extremely broad, which may make the evaluation of a rash extremely difficult.
An accurate evaluation by a doctor may only be made in the context of a thorough history (What medication is the patient taking? What is the patient's occupation? Where has the patient been?) and complete physical examination.
Weillâ€“Marchesani syndrome (also known as Spherophakia-brachymorphia syndrome, congenital mesodermal dystrophy, and GEMSS syndrome) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by short stature; an unusually short, broad head (brachycephaly) and other facial abnormalities; hand defects, including unusually short fingers (brachydactyly); and distinctive eye (ocular) abnormalities
It was named after ophthalmologists Georges Weill (1866-1952) and Oswald Marchesani (1900-1952) who first described it in 1932 and 1939, respectively
The eye manifestations typically include unusually small, round lenses of the eyes (spherophakia), which may be prone to dislocating (ectopia lentis), as well as other ocular defects
Due to such abnormalities, affected individuals may have varying degrees of visual impairment, ranging from nearsightedness myopia to blindness
Researchers suggest that Weillâ€“Marchesani syndrome may have autosomal recessive or autosomal dominant inheritance
Diagnosis is made when several characteristic clinical signs are observed
There is no single test to confirm the presence of Weillâ€“Marchesani syndrome
Exploring family history or examining other family members may prove helpful in confirming this diagnosis
Treatment and prognosisEye surgery has been documented to help those with ocular diseases, such as some forms of glaucoma
However, long term medical management of glaucoma has not proven to be successful for patients with Weillâ€“Marchesani syndrome
Mr cummings Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome or Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a syndrome caused by a virus called HIV.
How many people have AIDS?As of 2009, it is estimated that there are 33.3 million people worldwide infected with HIV.
The HIV pandemic is most severe in Sub-Saharan Africa.
Over 60% of all people with HIV live in the region.
Many people with HIV do not know they have it.
Because of this, the exact number of people with HIV is unknown.
Where HIV startedScientists believe the first human who got HIV was a person in Africa.
This happened when Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV) went from apes or chimpanzees to humans.
This virus probably crossed to humans by contact with monkey blood while cutting up monkeys to eat.
Alcoholism is the medical condition of people who often drink too much alcohol, or feel that they have to, even when it causes health and social problems.
Alcoholism means addiction to alcohol.
People who suffer from it are called alcoholics.
The overuse of alcohol has different causes, and there are different forms of treatment available.
Athlete's Foot is a condition where the foot is dry and cracked, which can be mildly painful.
It was named athlete's foot because it was common in people who play sports or do exercise.
The infection can be spread to other areas of the body, such as the armpits, knees and elbows.
SymptomsAthlete's foot causes scaling, flaking, itching, blisters and cracked skin.
It can be cured by using antibiotics.
Bladder cancer is cancer arising in the bladder.
It is much more common in men than in women.
Cardiac arrest occurs when the heart suddenly stops beating.
This can be caused by a heart attack in which the heart's demand for oxygen is not met and the heart muscle begins to die.
The sudden failure of normal circulation of blood due to failure of the heart to contract results in the body not getting enough oxygenated blood.
This causes cells to start to die from oxygen starvation.
Cerebral hypoxia (lack of oxygen to the brain) makes a person lose consciousness and stop breathing, and this makes the heart stop completely.
Unless the person is in hypothermia, brain damage usually occurs after three to five minutes.
In some cases, the person is put into hypothermia on purpose, to help the person recover better with less damage.
Cardiac arrest is a medical emergency.
If it is treated early enough, some of the damage done can be reversed in certain groups of patients.
When cardiac arrest leads to a person's death, this is called sudden cardiac death (SCD).
Chickenpox (or chicken pox) is a disease.
Usually it is children who get the disease, but adults can also get it (though its usually shingles they get).
People who have it get blisters, mostly on the body and in the face.
Those blisters are filled with a liquid.
At some point they will drain up, and there will be an urge to scratch.
Burst blisters usually heal without leaving scars, unless people scratch them open (which leads to an infection).
The symptoms come in 2 or 3 waves, and are usually accompanied by fever.
The disease can be very dangerous in pregnant women.
Chickenpox is caused by a virus of the herpes family.
The same virus can also cause shingles and rubella.
Dyslexia is a very common problem and has an effect on the way our brain understands words.
The most common signs of dyslexia are reading and writing problems.
Estimates are that in the United States between five and nine percent of schoolchildren have dyslexia, though estimates go as high as fifty percent.
A person can have dyslexia even if he or she is very smart or educated.
Recent studies show that there are many small business owners that have dyslexia; between 35 and 50 percent of U.S. and British entrepreneurs are affected.
Researchers think that many dyslexic entrepreneurs are successful because they can delegate responsibilities (of writing letters) and still be good at speaking.
At the end of the 20th century, scientists did a lot of research about dyslexia and found some of the reasons that people are dyslexic.
A professor who did research in the 1980s and 1990s looked at the brains of dyslexic people who had died.
He found that some parts of the brain were not connected very well, and that this happened during the fourth month of pregnancy.
This problem has a big effect on the left half of the brain.
Encephalopathy means disease of the brain.
Most of the time, it is used by Pathologists, to speak about dead brains.
When talking about the living, people usually use the word dementia.
Erythema ab igne is a rash of the skin, which is usually caused by the long-term exposure to heat or infrared radiation,and which is not a burn. 
Usually the name is abbreviated EAI. 
Other names include hot water bottle rashfire stains,laptop thigh, granny's tartan and toasted skin syndrome.
Some people may complain of mild itchiness and a burning sensation. 
When a change in skin pigmentation can not be seen, it is often not noticed at all.
Food poisoning is when someone gets sick from eating food or drink that has gone bad or is contaminated.
There are two kinds of food poisoning: poisoning by toxic agent or by infectious agent.
Food infection is when the food contains bacteria or other microbes which infect the body after it is eaten.
Food intoxication is when the food contains toxins, including bacterially produced exotoxins, which can happen even when the microbe that produced the toxin is no longer present or able to cause infection.
Even though it is commonly called food poisoning, most cases are caused by a variety of pathogenic bacteria, viruses, prions or parasites that contaminate food,rather than chemical or natural toxins which are what we usually call poison.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 76 million people in the United States become ill from the food they eat, and about 5,000 of them die every year.
Signs and symptomsSymptoms start within hours to many days after eating.
Depending on what the cause of the poisoning was, they can include one or more of the following: nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhoea, gastroenteritis, fever, pain in the head or fatigue.
In most cases the body is able to permanently get better after a short period of acute discomfort and illness.
Foodborne illnesses can result in permanent health problems or even death, especially for people at high risk, including babies, young children, pregnant women (and their fetuses), elderly people, sick people and others with weak immune systems.
Hepatitis C is an infection that mostly affects the liver.
The hepatitis C virus (HCV) causes this disease.
Often, a person with Hepatitis C does not have any symptoms (health problems or signs that he has the disease).
However, chronic infection can scar the liver.
Many years of infection may cause cirrhosis.
Sometimes, people with cirrhosis also have liver failure or liver cancer.
They can also have very swollen veins of the esophagus and stomach.
The blood loss from this problem can kill.
Hepatitis C is usually spread by blood-to-blood contact (when blood from a person with Hepatitis C contacts (touches or gets into) another person's bloodstream).
The most common ways that this happens are through intravenous drug use (when a person shoots drugs into one of their veins, with a needle that was already used by a person infected with Hepatitis C); nonsterile medical equipment (medical tools that were not cleaned well enough after being used on an infected person); and blood transfusions (when a person is given blood that came from an infected person).
Hypertension also called High blood pressure is a disease where your blood pressure is always above average.
There is no fixed point when blood pressure is considered high.
Generally, if a person's blood pressure stays at 140/90 torr (a unit of pressure) or above in both arms, that person has high blood pressure.
A recent report has defined blood pressure 120/80 torr to 139/89 torr as prehypertension.
Prehypertension is not a disease, but means that a person has a high risk of developing hypertension.
In patients with diabetes mellitus or kidney disease, studies have shown that blood pressure over 130/80 torr should be considered a risk factor and may need treatment.
A number of factors increase the risk of developing hypertension, including high salt use, being overweight, occupation, drinking alcohol, family size, excessive noise and crowding.
High salt use has received the greatest attention.
Aproximately 60% of the hypertension patients are affected by salt use.
Hypertension is one of the most common complex inherited disorders, about 30% of cases.
Hyperthyroidism is a medical condition.
It is caused by a thyroid gland that is too active.
The thyroid gland makes hormones.
These hormones manage the bodyâ€™s metabolism.
An example of one of these hormones is thyroxine.
The thyroid-stimulating hormone starts the making of thyroxine.
The thyroid-stimulating hormone is also called â€œTSH.€
TSH is made in the pituitary gland.
Hyperthyroidism is determined by a doctor by blood tests that show a decreased thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level.
The most common cause of this disorder is Gravesâ€™ disease.
Impetigo is a very contagious bacterial skin infection.
It is most common in pre-school children.
People who play close-contact sports like rugby and American football are also at risk.
Impetigo is not very common in adults.
Impetigo can also be called school sores.
Infertile means not able to have children or other offspring.
Humans can be infertile, but animals and plants can too.
When a human couple is infertile, they sometimes have fertility treatment to have children.
This can be insemination or IVF.
They also sometimes adopt a child.
Influenza (or the flu, the grippe) is a very common disease.
It is contagious, so it passes from one person to another very easily.
Usually, it spreads around the world in seasonal epidemics.
In the 20th century, there were three big epidemics (called pandemics) that killed millions of people.
A type of flu is Avian flu.
People sometimes mistook influenza for the common cold.
The flu affects the upper airways and the lungs.
While there is no cure, there is a vaccine that must be given yearly to avoid infection.
Lassa fever or Lassa hemorrhagic fever (LHF) is a fever caused by the Lassa virus.
It is common in West Africa.
One in 80 people who get Lassa fever will die.
Some cases are severe and require going to a hospital.
These cases have a death rate of 1 in 5.
Lassa Fever was discovered in 1969 after two nurses died from the disease.
It was named for the town in Nigeria where it was first diagnosed.
How people get Lassa feverLassa fever is transmitted from rodents to humans.
It is caused by direct contact with rodent droppings.
It can also be transmitted by humans to other humans by their blood.
Lead poisoning is a condition where there is too much lead in the body.
Lead interferes with many processes, and is toxic to many organs and tissues.
Treatment of the condition is usually focused on removing the source of lead.
Liposarcoma is a malignant tumor.
It is found on fat cells in deep soft tissue, such as that inside the thigh or in the retroperitoneum.
They are typically large bulky tumors.
Liposarcomas, like all sarcomas, are rare.
Lyme disease or borreliosis, is an infectious disease.
It is caused by bacteria of the genus Borrelia.
The disease is carried by ticks which are parasitic on mammals such as mice and deer.
In other words, ticks are the vector which transmits the disease.
It is the most common tick-borne infection in the United States.
Although Allen Steere realized in 1978 that Lyme disease was a tick-borne disease, the cause of the disease remained a mystery until 1982.
It can cause joint swelling, rashes, and neurological disorders.
Malaria is an infectious disease caused by a parasite: it is spread by the bite of an infected mosquito.
People catch malaria when the parasite enters the blood.
The parasite causes a deadly infection which kills many people each year.
The parasite that causes malaria is a protozoan called Plasmodium.
Protozoa are organisms with only one cell, but they are not bacteria.
Bacteria are smaller and simpler than protozoa.
People usually get malaria from the Anopheles or Culex mosquitoes: they are the vectors of the disease.
The Plasmodium gets into people by the bites of mosquitoes.
The Plasmodium is in the mosquito's special saliva.
The mosquito's saliva injects an anticoagulant into the person to prevent their blood from clotting.
Mesothelioma is a cancer that hits the lungs.
It has many possible causes, in particular asbestos.
This cancer can be deadly.
It is different from asbestosis, another disease caused by asbestos.
Mesothelioma has been the subject of many lawsuits, and many lawyers specialize in mesothelioma and asbestosis.
The Myelodysplastic syndrome is a group of diseases and conditions that affect how blood is made.
These diseases were formerly known as preleukemia, mostly because sometimes they can lead to leukemia.
Often, its name is shortened to MDS.
Myelodysplastic syndromes affect the bone marrow stem cells.
The production of blood does not rely on good stem cells, but ones that have been modified genetically.
This means that the production of red blood cells, sometimes of white blood cells and blood platelets changed.
The production becomes inefficient, or goes wrong altogether.
Most of the time, this manifests in anemia - not having enough blood.
Depending on the severity of the condition, it can also cause hemorrhages and infections with fever.
Most of the people who have these conditions are 60 years or older, but younger people can get it too, especially if they went through a form of chemotherapy.
Nyctalopia (Greek for Night blindness) is a disease of the human eyes.
The eyes of people who are night-blind cannot adapt to situations where there is relatively little light; as a result, they have trouble seeing in such situations.
Obesity is the condition of being much too heavy for one's height so that one's health is affected.
In other words, it means to be too overweight.
Also known as being fat.
It is considered a diseaseand has been described as an epidemic.
To know if a person is overweight, the body mass index (BMI) is calculated, by dividing the person's weight (in kilograms), by their height (in meters) squared (multiplied by itself).
(This is only meaningful for adults who are fully grown, and should not be used for children.
Growth charts can be used to measure obesity in children.) 
A BMI between 20 and 25 is considered normal.
People with a BMI of 25 or more are said to be overweight; with 30 and above, they are considered obese, and with 35 and above, they are considered severely obese (this used to be called morbidly obese).
In general, the BMI number is a good quantifiable measurement of a person's obesity.
Obsessiveâ€“compulsive disorder (often shortened to OCD) is an mental disorder that causes repeated and unwanted thoughts and/or feelings (obsessions) and actions (compulsions).
Anxiety is one of the most common symptoms and can lead the individual to believe that if a task is not completed, something bad may happen.
Such a task may be washing hands five times.
This belief leads to more anxiety and tension.
The actions that someone takes to stop the thoughts and feelings can take more than an hour every day.
Â OCD can limit one's ability to take part in relationships, the workplace, and in society in general.
OCD affects around 1. 2% of the world's population, and it affects the lives of around 15%.
In theUnited States, about one in fifty adults has OCD.
Someone with obsessive-compulsive disorder has thoughts called obsessions.
A thought that is an obsession will happen many times and is a thought that the person does not want to have.
Ovarian cancer is cancer that involves different regions of the ovary.
Recent evidence suggests the Fallopian tube may be related to the cancer.
Other types of this condition involve egg cells.
The risk increases with age and decreases with pregnancy.
Ovarian cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer death for females, and the survival rates for this condition vary.
Paratyphoid fever, also known as enteric fever, is a waterborne disease caused by the bacterium Salmonella Paratyphi.
It is related to Typhoid fever, but like Typhoid, it is unrelated to Typhus.
Symptoms include: The disease is rarely fatal and people usually recover in a few days, but some people can carry the bacteria for months.
Parkinson's disease (or PD) is a disease that slowly damages the central nervous system.
The central nervous system is made up of the brain and spine.
When a person gets Parkinson's disease, the cells that make dopamine in a part of the brain die.
Dopamine cells send information to other cells which makes us do the actions we do.
Because of this, Parkinson's disease mainly affects the body's motor system.
Parkinson's disease is a disease that gets worse over time.
People normally get Parkinson’s disease when they are over 50 years old.
It is sometimes very hard for doctors to detect.
Doctors are studying the exact causes Parkinson's.
Progeria (pronunciation: /proÊŠËˆdÊ’ÉªÉ™riÉ™/), also called Hutchinsonâ€“Gilford progeria syndromeand HGPS progeria syndromeis a very rare genetic disorder.
Children born with progeria show symptoms which are like aging.
This can include skin wrinkles and grey hair or baldness.
rogeria is one of several progeroid syndromes.
The word progeria comes from the Greek words pro (Ï€Ï?ÏŒ), meaning before or premature, and gÄ“ras (Î³á¿†Ï?Î±Ï‚), meaning old age.
It is very rare, only 1 child in every 8 million live births.
People with progeria usually only live to their mid teens to early twenties.
It is a genetic condition that occurs as a new mutation.
It is rarely inherited, as people with the condition do not usually live long enough to have children.
Scientists are studying progeria because it might reveal clues about the normal process of aging.
Prostate cancer is a disease in which cancer develops in the prostate, a gland in the male reproductive system.
It is often treated with prostatectomy, radiotherapy, or hormonal therapy.
Aggressive prostate cancer is now known to have a genetic basis.
Men with gene BRCA2 are more likely to get the cancer, and more likely it will be in its most aggressive form.
Rabies is a neurotropic virus, viral zoonotic disease that causes acute encephalitis.
Usually, people (and animals) die from it (it is fatal).
There is no cure for it.
People who are treated soon after becoming infected have a chance to survive.
The disease is transmitted through the saliva and the blood.
The usual form of getting it is a bite of a rabid mammal.
Pets, like dogs need to be vaccinated against it, in most countries.
TreatmentThere is no cure for Rabies.
There is a vaccine against it.
The vaccine was first developed by Louis Pasteur and Pierre Paul Émile Roux in 1885.
Rosacea is a chronic facial condition that is characterized through acne and redness.
It can happen to people of any age.
It gets worse if left untreated.
There are four types of rosacea, three involving human skin and the fourth affecting eyes.
Rosacea affects mostly Caucasians, though some other races can be affected.
Rosacea affects both males and females.
Females are three times more likely than males to get rosacea.
Things that can cause rosacea are exposure of the face to extreme temperature, the heat of sunlight, severe sunburn, stress, anxiety, alcohol and spicy foods.
Most people with rosacea have only mild redness and are never officially diagnosed or treated.
Skin cancer is the term that is used for all bad forms of growth of the skin.
In everyday use, people often talk about melanoma, but there are other forms of skin cancer, too.
These are usually named after the type of cell that grows uncontrollably.
Most skin cancers develop in the epidermis.
Very often a tumor can be seen, so it is often possible to detect skin cancer at an early stage.
Very few people with skin cancer will die of the disease, though it can be disfiguring.
Melanoma survival rates are poorer than for non-melanoma skin cancer, although when melanoma is diagnosed at an early stage, treatment is easier and more people survive.
Skin cancer is the most commonly diagnosed type of cancer.
Melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancers combined are more common than lung, breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer.
Melanoma is less common than both basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, but it is the most serious — for example, in the UK there were over 11,700 new cases of melanoma in 2008, and over 2,000 deaths.
Anorexia nervosa (usually just called anorexia) is an eating disorder.
People with anorexia think that they are fat, or desperately fear becoming fat even if they are very skinny.
To try to lose weight, anorexics do not eat enough.
