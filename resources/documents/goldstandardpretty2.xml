<sentence> Anaplasmosis is a disease caused by a rickettsial parasite of ruminants , Anaplasma spp .</sentence>
<sentence> The organism occurs in the erythrocytes and is transmitted by natural means through by a number of haematophagous species of ticks and flies .</sentence>
<sentence> It can also be transmitted iatrogenically by the use of surgical , dehorning , castration , and tattoo instruments and hypodermic needles that are<sentneg>not</sentneg>  disinfected between uses .</sentence>
<sentence> The organism can go through a complete lifecycle in the gut of certain species of ticks but the flies appear to be only a mechanical vector , thus ,<sentneg>not</sentneg>  as important in the maintaining the disease in any given area .</sentence>
<sentence> The disease causes severe anemia and wasting in adult cattle which are infected .</sentence>
<sentence> Young cattle and most other ruminants will<sentneg>not</sentneg>  show clinical signs if infected but may serve as carriers .</sentence>
<sentence> Since the organism hides from the body 's immune system in red blood cells , it is difficult if<sentneg>not</sentneg>  impossible for an infection to be totally cleared .</sentence>
<sentence> As the immune response wanes , the organism again builds up and the host relapses .</sentence>
<sentence> In the United States , anaplasmosis is notably present in the south and west where the tick hosts Dermacentor spp .</sentence>
<sentence> are found .</sentence>
<sentence> Although vaccines have been developed ,<sentneg>none</sentneg>  are currently available in the United States .</sentence>
<sentence> Apraxia is a motor disorder caused by damage to the brain -LRB- specifically the posterior parietal cortex -RRB- , in which someone has difficulty with the motor planning to perform tasks or movements when asked , provided that the request or command is understood and he/she is willing to perform the task .</sentence>
<sentence> A person with apraxia can<sentneg>not</sentneg>  move his or her lips or tongue to the right place to say sounds correctly because , even though the muscles are<sentneg>not</sentneg>  weak , the messages from the brain to the mouth are disrupted .</sentence>
<sentence> The nature of the brain damage determines the severity .</sentence>
<sentence doublenegation="true"> Apraxia is an acquired disorder of motor planning , but is<sentneg>not</sentneg>  caused by<morphneg>incoordination</morphneg>  , sensory loss , or failure to comprehend simple commands -LRB- which can be tested by asking the person to recognize the correct movement from a series -RRB- .</sentence>
<sentence> It is caused by damage to specific areas of the cerebrum .</sentence>
<sentence> Apraxia should<sentneg>not</sentneg>  be confused with ataxia , a lack of coordination of movements ; aphasia , an<morphneg>inability</morphneg>  to produce and/or comprehend language ; abulia , the lack of desire to carry out an action ; or allochiria , in which patients perceive stimuli to one side of the body as occurring on the other .</sentence>
<sentence> Developmental coordination disorder is the developmental disorder of motor planning .</sentence>
<sentence> There are several types of apraxia including : Each type may be tested at decreasing levels of complexity ; if the person tested fails to execute the commands , you can make the movement yourself and ask that the person mimic it , or you can even give them a real object -LRB- like a toothbrush -RRB- and ask them to use it .</sentence>
<sentence> Apraxia of speech -LRB- AOS -RRB- is a neurologic speech disorder that reflects an impaired capacity to plan or program sensorimotor commands necessary for directing movements that result in phonetically and prosodically normal speech .</sentence>
<sentence> It occurs in both children -LRB- childhood apraxia of speech -RRB- and adults -LRB- acquired apraxia of speech -RRB- who have -LRB- prior to the onset of apraxia -RRB- acquired some level of speaking ability .</sentence>
<sentence> Beriberi refers to a cluster of symptoms caused primarily by a nutritional deficit in vitamin B1 -LRB- thiamine -RRB- .</sentence>
<sentence> Beriberi has conventionally been divided into three separate entities , relating to the body system mainly involved -LRB- peripheral nervous system or cardiovascular -RRB- or age of person -LRB- like infantile -RRB- .</sentence>
<sentence> Beriberi is one of several thiamine-deficiency related conditions , which may occur concurrently , including Wernicke 's encephalopathy -LRB- mainly affecting the central nervous system -RRB- , Korsakoff 's syndrome -LRB- amnesia with additional psychiatric manifestations -RRB- , and Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome -LRB- with both neurologic and psychiatric symptoms -RRB- .</sentence>
<sentence doublenegation="true"> Historically , beriberi has been common in regions where what is variously referred to as polished or white rice forms a major part of the diet , which has its husk removed to extend its shelf life and palatability but has the side effect of removing the primary source of thiamine.It was<sentneg>not</sentneg>  known<morphneg>until</morphneg>  the end of the 19th century that polishing rice was associated with beriberi .</sentence>
<sentence> Symptoms of beriberi include weight loss , emotional disturbances , impaired sensory perception , weakness and pain in the limbs , and periods of<morphneg>irregular</morphneg>  heart rate .</sentence>
<sentence> Edema -LRB- swelling of bodily tissues -RRB- is common .</sentence>
<sentence> It may increase the amount of lactic acid and pyruvic acid within the blood .</sentence>
<sentence> In advanced cases , the disease may cause high-output cardiac failure and death .</sentence>
<sentence> Symptoms may occur concurrently with those of Wernicke 's encephalopathy , a primarily neurological thiamine-deficiency related condition .</sentence>
<sentence> Beriberi is divided into three historical classifications , a fourth form , gastrointestinal beriberi , was recognized in 2004 : Dry beriberi causes wasting and partial paralysis resulting from damaged peripheral nerves .</sentence>
<sentence> An abscess -LRB- Latin : abscessus -RRB- is a collection of pus that has built up within the tissue of the body .</sentence>
<sentence> Signs and symptoms of abscesses include redness , pain , warmth , and swelling .</sentence>
<sentence> The swelling may feel fluid filled when pressed .</sentence>
<sentence> The area of redness often extends beyond the swelling .</sentence>
<sentence> Carbuncles and boils are types of abscess that often involve hair follicles with carbuncles being larger .</sentence>
<sentence> They are usually caused by a bacterial infection .</sentence>
<sentence> Often many different types of bacteria are involved in a single infection .</sentence>
<sentence> In the United States and many other areas of the world the most common bacteria present is methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus .</sentence>
<sentence> Rarely , parasites can cause abscesses and this is more common in the developing world .</sentence>
<sentence> Bubonic plague is one of three types of bacterial infection caused by Yersinia pestis .</sentence>
<sentence> Three to seven days after exposure to the bacteria flu like symptoms develop .</sentence>
<sentence> This includes fever , headaches , and vomiting .</sentence>
<sentence> Swollen and painful lymph nodes occur in the area closest to where the bacteria entered the skin .</sentence>
<sentence> Occasionally the swollen lymph nodes may break open .</sentence>
<sentence> The three types of plague are the result of the route of infection : bubonic plague , septicemic plague , and pneumonic plague .</sentence>
<sentence> Bubonic plague is mainly spread by infected fleas from small animals .</sentence>
<sentence> It may also result from exposure to the body fluids from a dead plague infected animal .</sentence>
<sentence> In the bubonic form of plague , the bacteria enter through the skin through a flea bite and travel via the lymphatic vessels to a lymph node , causing it to swell .</sentence>
<sentence> Diagnosis is by finding the bacteria in the blood , sputum , or fluid from lymph nodes .</sentence>
<sentence> Cerebral palsy -LRB- CP -RRB- is a group of permanent movement disorders that appear in early childhood .</sentence>
<sentence> Signs and symptoms vary between people .</sentence>
<sentence> Often , symptoms include poor coordination , stiff muscles , weak muscles , and tremors .</sentence>
<sentence> There may be problems with sensation , vision , hearing , swallowing , and speaking .</sentence>
<sentence> Often babies with cerebral palsy do<sentneg>not</sentneg>  roll over , sit , crawl , or walk as early as other children their age .</sentence>
<sentence> Difficulty with the ability to think or reason and seizures each occurs in about one third of people with CP .</sentence>
<sentence> While the symptoms may get more noticeable over the first few years of life , the underlying problems do<sentneg>not</sentneg>  worsen over time .</sentence>
<sentence> cerebral palsy is caused by<morphneg>abnormal</morphneg>  development or damage to the parts of the brain that control movement , balance , and posture .</sentence>
<sentence> Most often the problems occur during pregnancy ; however , they may also occur during childbirth , or shortly after birth .</sentence>
<sentence> Often the cause is<morphneg>unknown</morphneg>  .</sentence>
<sentence> Chagas disease , also known as American trypanosomiasis , is a tropical parasitic disease caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi .</sentence>
<sentence> It is spread mostly by insects known as Triatominae or kissing bugs .</sentence>
<sentence> The symptoms change over the course of the infection .</sentence>
<sentence> In the early stage , symptoms are typically either<sentneg>not</sentneg>  present or mild , and may include fever , swollen lymph nodes , headaches , or local swelling at the site of the bite .</sentence>
<sentence> After 8 -- 12 weeks , individuals enter the chronic phase of disease and in 60 -- 70 % it<sentneg>never</sentneg>  produces further symptoms .</sentence>
<sentence> The other 30 to 40 % of people develop further symptoms 10 to 30 years after the initial infection , including enlargement of the ventricles of the heart in 20 to 30 % , leading to heart failure .</sentence>
<sentence> An enlarged esophagus or an enlarged colon may also occur in 10 % of people .</sentence>
<sentence> T. cruzi is commonly spread to humans and other mammals by the blood-sucking kissing bugs of the subfamily Triatominae .</sentence>
<sentence> These insects are known by a number of local names , including : vinchuca in Argentina , Bolivia , Chile and Paraguay , barbeiro -LRB- the barber -RRB- in Brazil , pito in Colombia , chinche in Central America , and chipo in Venezuela .</sentence>
<sentence> The disease may also be spread through blood transfusion , organ transplantation , eating food contaminated with the parasites , and by vertical transmission -LRB- from a mother to her fetus -RRB- .</sentence>
<sentence> Coronavirus is a genus of animal virus belonging to the family Coronaviridae.Coronaviruses are enveloped viruses with a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome and a helical symmetry .</sentence>
<sentence> The genomic size of coronaviruses ranges from approximately 16 to 31 kilobases , extraordinarily large for an RNA virus .</sentence>
<sentence> The name coronavirus is derived from the greek ÎºÎ ¿ Ï?ÏŽÎ 1/2 Î ± , meaning crown , as the virus envelope appears under electron microscopy -LRB- E.M. -RRB- to be crowned by a characteristic ring of small bulbous structures .</sentence>
<sentence> This morphology is actually formed by the viral spike -LRB- S -RRB- peplomers , which are proteins that populate the surface of the virus and determine host tropism .</sentence>
<sentence> Coronaviruses are grouped in the order Nidovirales , named for the Latin nidus , meaning nest , as all viruses in this order produce a 3 ' co-terminal nested set of subgenomic mRNA 's during infection .</sentence>
<sentence> Proteins that contribute to the overall structure of all coronaviruses are the spike -LRB- S -RRB- , envelope -LRB- E -RRB- , membrane -LRB- M -RRB- and nucleocapsid -LRB- N -RRB- .</sentence>
<sentence> In the specific case of SARS -LRB- see below -RRB- , a defined receptor-binding domain on S mediates the attachment of the virus to its cellular receptor , angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 -LRB- ACE2 -RRB- .</sentence>
<sentence> Members of the group 2 coronaviruses also have a shorter spike-like protein called hemagglutinin esterase -LRB- HE -RRB- encoded in their genome , but for some reason this protein is<sentneg>not</sentneg>  always brought to expression -LRB- produced -RRB- in the cell .</sentence>
<sentence> Diseases of coronavirus Coronaviruses primarily infect the upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tract of mammals and birds .</sentence>
<sentence> Four to five different currently known strains of coronaviruses infect humans .</sentence>
<sentence> Corynebacterium diphtheriae is a pathogenic bacterium that causes diphtheria .</sentence>
<sentence> It is also known as the Klebs-Löffler bacillus , because it was discovered in 1884 by German bacteriologists Edwin Klebs -LRB- 1834 -- 1912 -RRB- and Friedrich Löffler -LRB- 1852 -- 1915 -RRB- .</sentence>
<sentence> Morphology and toxin production C. diphtheriae is a facultatively aerobic Gram positive organism , characterized by<morphneg>non-encapsulated</morphneg>  ,<morphneg>non-sporulated</morphneg>  , immobile , straight or curved rods with a length of 1 to 8 µm and width of 0.3 to 0.8 µm , which form ramified aggregations in culture -LRB- looking like Chinese characters -RRB- .</sentence>
<sentence> The bacterium may contain polymetaphosphate aggregates called Volutin granules .</sentence>
<sentence> It is pathogenic only in humans .</sentence>
<sentence> C. diphtheriae produce diphtheria toxin , a proteic exotoxin , with a molecular weight of 62 kilodaltons which ADP-ribosylates host EF-2 , resulting in the inhibition of protein synthesis and thus is responsible for the signs of diphtheria .</sentence>
<sentence> The inactivation of this toxin with an antitoxic serum -LRB- antitoxin -RRB- is the basis of the antidiphtheric therapeutic vaccination .</sentence>
<sentence> However ,<sentneg>not</sentneg>  all strains are toxigenic ; the ability to produce the exotoxin is conferred on the bacterium when it is infected by a bacteriophage -LRB- a mechanism termed lysogenic activation -RRB- .</sentence>
<sentence> A<morphneg>non-toxigenic</morphneg>  strain can thus become toxigenic by the infection of such a bacteriophage .</sentence>
<sentence> The four subspecies differ slightly in their colonial morphology and biochemical properties such as the ability to metabolize certain nutrients , but all may be toxigenic -LRB- and therefore cause diphtheria -RRB- or<morphneg>non-toxigenic</morphneg>  .</sentence>
<sentence> Dent 's disease -LRB- or Dent disease -RRB- is a rare X-linked recessive inherited condition that affects the proximal renal tubulesof the kidney .</sentence>
<sentence> It is one cause of Fanconi syndrome , and is characterized by tubular proteinuria , excess calcium in the urine , formation of calcium kidney stones , nephrocalcinosis , and chronic kidney failure .</sentence>
<sentence> Dent 's disease is often used to describe an entire group of familial disorders , including X-linked recessive nephrolithiasis with kidney failure , X-linked recessive hypophosphatemic rickets , and both Japanese and idiopathic low-molecular-weight proteinuria .</sentence>
<sentence> About 60 % of patients have mutations in the CLCN5 gene -LRB- Dent 1 -RRB- , which encodes a kidney-specific chloride/proton antiporter , and 15 % of patients have mutations in the OCRL1 gene -LRB- Dent 2 -RRB- .</sentence>
<sentence> Signs and symptomsDent 's disease often produces the following signs and symptoms : In a study of 25 patients with Dent 's disease ,9 of 15 men , and one of 10 women suffered end-stage kidney disease by the age of 47 .</sentence>
<sentence> GeneticsDent 's disease is a X-linked recessive disorder .</sentence>
<sentence> The males are prone to manifesting symptoms in early adulthood with symptoms of calculi , rickets or even with kidney failure in more severe cases .</sentence>
<sentence> In humans , gene CLCN5 is located on chromosome Xp11 .22 , and has a 2238-bp coding sequence that consists of 11 exons that span 25 to 30 kb of genomic DNA and encode a 746-amino-acid protein .</sentence>
<sentence> CLCN5 belongs to the family of voltage-gated chloride channel genes -LRB- CLCN1-CLCN7 , CLCKa and CLCKb -RRB- that have about 12 transmembrane domains .</sentence>
<sentence> These chloride channels have an important role in the control of membrane excitability , transepithelial transport , and possibly cell volume .</sentence>

<sentence> Most infections are light and asymptomatic .</sentence>
<sentence> In heavier infections , symptoms include diarrhea , abdominal pain , fever , ascites , anasarca , and intestinal obstruction .</sentence>
<sentence> Laboratory diagnosis Microscopic identification of eggs , or more rarely of the adult flukes , in the stool or vomitus is the basis of specific diagnosis .</sentence>
<sentence> The eggs are<morphneg>indistinguishable</morphneg>  from those of Fasciola hepatica .</sentence>
<sentence> Triclabendazole is the drug of choice for treatment of fasciolopsiasis .</sentence>
<sentence> Hepatitis B is an infectious disease caused by the hepatitis B virus -LRB- HBV -RRB- which affects the liver .</sentence>
<sentence> It can cause both acute and chronic infections .</sentence>
<sentence> Many people have<sentneg>no</sentneg>  symptoms during the initial infection .</sentence>

<sentence> Hypothermia is a condition in which an organism 's temperature drops below that required for normal metabolism and bodily functions .</sentence>
<sentence> In warm-blooded animals , core body temperature is maintained near a constant level through biologic homeostasis .</sentence>
<sentence> But when the body is exposed to cold its internal mechanisms may be<morphneg>unable</morphneg>  to replenish the heat that is being lost to the organism 's surroundings .</sentence>
<sentence> Hypothermia is the opposite of hyperthermia , the condition which causes heat exhaustion and heat stroke .</sentence>
<sentence> Symptoms Normal body temperature in humans is 98.6 °F .</sentence>
<sentence> Hypothermia can be divided in three stages of severity .</sentence>
<sentence> In stage 1 , body temperature drops by 1-2 °C below normal temperature -LRB- 1.8-3 .6 °F -RRB- .</sentence>
<sentence> Mild to strong shivering occurs .</sentence>
<sentence> The victim is<morphneg>unable</morphneg>  to perform complex tasks with the hands ; the hands become numb .</sentence>
<sentence> Blood vessels in the outer extremities constrict , lessening heat loss to the outside air .</sentence>

<sentence> In humans ,<morphneg>infertility</morphneg>  may describe a woman who is<morphneg>unable</morphneg>  to conceive as well as being<morphneg>unable</morphneg>  to carry a pregnancy to full term .</sentence>
<sentence> There are many biological and other causes of<morphneg>infertility</morphneg>  , including some that medical intervention can treat .</sentence>
<sentence> Estimates from 1997 suggest that worldwide between three and seven per cent of all couples or women have an<morphneg>unresolved</morphneg>  problem of<morphneg>infertility</morphneg>  .</sentence>
<sentence> Many more couples , however , experience<morphneg>involuntary</morphneg>  childlessness for at least one year : estimates range from 12 % to 28 % .</sentence>
<sentence> 20-30 % of<morphneg>infertility</morphneg>  cases are due to male<morphneg>infertility</morphneg>  , 20-35 % are due to female<morphneg>infertility</morphneg>  , and 25-40 % are due to combined problems in both parts .</sentence>
<sentence> In 10-20 % of cases ,<sentneg>no</sentneg>  cause is found .</sentence>
<sentence> The most common cause of female<morphneg>infertility</morphneg>  is ovulatory problems which generally manifest themselves by sparse or absent menstrual periods .</sentence>
<sentence> Male<morphneg>infertility</morphneg>  is most commonly due to deficiencies in the semen , and semen quality is used as a surrogate measure of male fecundity .</sentence>
<sentence> A keloid -LRB- / ËˆkiË?lÉ '' Éªd / ; also keloidal scar -RRB- is the formation of a type of scar which , depending on its maturity , is composed mainly of either type III -LRB- early -RRB- or type I -LRB- late -RRB- collagen .</sentence>
<sentence> It is a result of an overgrowth of granulation tissue -LRB- collagen type 3 -RRB- at the site of a healed skin injury which is then slowly replaced by collagen type 1 .</sentence>

<sentence> A keloid scar is benign and<sentneg>not</sentneg>  contagious , but sometimes accompanied by severe itchiness , pain , and changes in texture .</sentence>
<sentence> In severe cases , it can affect movement of skin .</sentence>
<sentence> Keloid scars are seen 15 times more frequently in people of African decent than in people of European decent .</sentence>
<sentence> Keloids should<sentneg>not</sentneg>  be confused with hypertrophic scars , which are raised scars that do<sentneg>not</sentneg>  grow beyond the boundaries of the original wound .</sentence>
<sentence> Signs and symptomsKeloids expand in claw-like growths over normal skin .</sentence>
<sentence> They have the capability to hurt with a needle-like pain or to itch , although the degree of sensation varies from person to person .</sentence>
<sentence> If the keloid becomes infected , it may ulcerate .</sentence>
<sentence> Keratitis is a condition in which the eye 's cornea , the front part of the eye , becomes inflamed .</sentence>
<sentence> The condition is often marked by moderate to intense pain and usually involves impaired eye sight .</sentence>
<sentence> Types Superficial keratitis involves the superficial layers of the cornea .</sentence>
<sentence> After healing , this form of keratitis does<sentneg>not</sentneg>  generally leave a scar .</sentence>
<sentence> Deep keratitis involves deeper layers of the cornea , leaving a scar upon healing that impairs vision if on or near the visual axis .</sentence>
<sentence> Causes Keratitis has multiple causes , one of which is an infection of a present or previous herpes simplex virus secondary to an upper respiratory infection , involving cold sores .</sentence>
<sentence> The symptoms are often very similar to those of conjunctivitis , an inflammation of the conjunctiva , and photophobia .</sentence>
<sentence> The eye turns very red and there may be sensitivity to light , and the eye may feel<morphneg>uncomfortable</morphneg>  .</sentence>
<sentence> In the later stages of more severe cases , there can be strong pain , loss of vision/blurriness , and pus may form .</sentence>
<sentence> Effective diagnosis is important in detecting this condition and subsequent treatment as keratitis is sometimes mistaken for an allergic conjunctivitis .</sentence>
<sentence> Treatment depends on the cause of the keratitis Infectious keratitis generally requires antibacterial , antifungal , or antiviral therapy is to treat the infection .</sentence>
<sentence> Many diseases of the liver are accompanied by jaundice caused by increased levels of bilirubin in the system .</sentence>
<sentence> The bilirubin results from the breakup of the hemoglobin of dead red blood cells ; normally , the liver removes bilirubin from the blood and excretes it through bile .</sentence>
<sentence> There are also many pediatric liver disease , including biliary atresia , alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency , alagille syndrome , and progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis , to name but a few .</sentence>
<sentence> A number of liver function tests are available to test the proper function of the liver .</sentence>
<sentence> These test for the presence of enzymes in blood that are normally most abundant in liver tissue , metabolites or products .</sentence>
<sentence> The external signs include a coated tongue , bad breath , skin rashes , itchy skin , excessive sweating , offensive body odour , dark circles under the eyes , red swollen and itchy eyes , acne rosacea , brownish spots and blemishes on the skin , flushed facial appearance or excessive facial blood vessels .</sentence>
<sentence> Other symptoms include jaundice , dark urine , pale stool , bone loss , easy bleeding , itching , small , spider-like blood vessels visible in the skin , enlarged spleen , fluid in the abdominal cavity , chills , pain from the biliary tract or pancrea , and an enlarged gallbladder .</sentence>
<sentence> The symptoms related to liver<morphneg>dysfunction</morphneg>  include both physical signs and a variety of symptoms related to digestive problems , blood sugar problems , immune disorders ,<morphneg>abnormal</morphneg>  absorption of fats , and metabolism problems .</sentence>
<sentence> The malabsorption of fats may lead to symptoms that include<morphneg>indigestion</morphneg>  , reflux , hemorhoids , gall stones ,<morphneg>intolerance</morphneg>  to fatty foods ,<morphneg>intolerance</morphneg>  to alcohol , nausea and vomiting attacks , abdominal bloating , and constipation .</sentence>
<sentence> Nervous system disorders include depression , mood changes , especially anger and irritability , poor concentration and foggy brain , overheating of the body , especially the face and torso , and recurrent headaches -LRB- including migraine -RRB- associated with nausea .</sentence>
<sentence> Mental retardation is a triarchic disorder , characterized by subaverage cognitive functioning and deficits in two or more adaptive behaviors with onset before the age of 18 .</sentence>
<sentence> Once focused almost entirely on cognition , the definition now includes both a component relating to mental functioning and one relating to the individual 's functional skills in their environment .</sentence>
<sentence> Alternative terms The term mental retardation is a diagnostic term designed to capture and standardize a group of<morphneg>disconnected</morphneg>  categories of mental functioning such as idiot , imbecile , and moron derived from early IQ tests , which acquired pejorative connotations in popular discourse over time .</sentence>
<sentence> The term mental retardation has itself now acquired some pejorative and shameful connotations over the last few decades due to the use of retarded as an insult among younger people .</sentence>
<sentence> This may in turn have contributed to its replacement with expressions such as mentally challenged or intellectual disability .</sentence>
<sentence> The American Association on Mental Retardation continued to use the term mental retardation<morphneg>until</morphneg>  2006 .</sentence>
<sentence> In June 2006 its members voted to change the name of the organization to the American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities , rejecting the options to become the AAID or AADD .</sentence>
<sentence> Part of the rationale for the double name was that many members worked with people with pervasive developmental disorders , most of whom are<sentneg>not</sentneg>  mentally retarded .</sentence>
<sentence> In the UK , mental handicap had become the common medical term , replacing mental subnormality in Scotland and mental deficiency in England and Wales ,<morphneg>until</morphneg>  Stephen Dorrell , Secretary of State for Health in England and Wales from 1995-7 , changed the NHS 's designation to learning disability .</sentence>
<sentence> The new term is<sentneg>not</sentneg>  yet widely understood , and is often taken to refer to problems affecting schoolwork -LRB- the American usage -RRB- : which are known in the UK as learning difficulties .</sentence>
<sentence> Osteomalacia is the softening of the bones caused by impaired bone metabolism primarily due to<morphneg>inadequate</morphneg>  levels of available phosphate , calcium , and vitamin D , or because of resorption of calcium .</sentence>
<sentence> The impairment of bone metabolism causes<morphneg>inadequate</morphneg>  bone remineralization .</sentence>
<sentence> Osteomalacia in children is known as rickets , and because of this , use of the term osteomalacia is often restricted to the milder , adult form of the disease .</sentence>
<sentence> Signs and symptoms can include diffuse body pains , muscle weakness , and fragility of the bones .</sentence>
<sentence> The most common cause of osteomalacia is a deficiency of vitamin D , which is normally derived from sunlight exposure and , to a lesser extent , from the diet .</sentence>
<sentence> The most specific screening test for vitamin D deficiency in otherwise healthy individuals is a serum 25 -LRB- OH -RRB- D level .</sentence>
<sentence> Less common causes of osteomalacia can include hereditary deficiencies of vitamin D or phosphate -LRB- which would typically be identified in childhood -RRB- or malignancy .</sentence>
<sentence> Measures to prevent and treat osteomalacia usually revolve around intake of vitamin D and calcium supplements .</sentence>
<sentence> Vitamin D should always be administered in conjunction with calcium supplementation since most of the consequences of vitamin D deficiency are a result of impaired mineral ion homeostasis .</sentence>
<sentence> Nursing home residents and the homebound elderly population are at particular risk for vitamin D deficiency , as these populations typically receive little sun exposure .</sentence>
<sentence> Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors -LRB- PanNETs , PETs , or PNETs -RRB- , often referred to as islet cell tumors , or pancreatic endocrine tumorsare neuroendocrine neoplasms that arise from cells of the endocrine -LRB- hormonal -RRB- and nervous system within the pancreas .</sentence>
<sentence> PanNETs are a type of neuroendocrine tumor , representing about one third of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors -LRB- GEP-NETs -RRB- .</sentence>
<sentence> Many PanNETs are benign , while some are malignant .</sentence>
<sentence> Aggressive PanNET tumors have traditionally been termed islet cell carcinoma .</sentence>
<sentence> PanNETs are quite distinct from the usual form of pancreatic cancer , the majority of which are adenocarcinomas , which arises in the exocrine pancreas .</sentence>
<sentence> Only 1 or 2 % of clinically significant pancreas neoplasms are PanNETs .</sentence>
<sentence> PanNETs are sometimes abbreviated as PETs or PNETs : such use should<sentneg>not</sentneg>  to be confused with the primitive neuroectodermal tumor -LRB- PNET -RRB- .</sentence>
<sentence> The majority of PanNETs are benign , while some are malignant .</sentence>
<sentence> The World Health Organization -LRB- WHO -RRB- classification scheme places neuroendocrine tumors into three main categories , which emphasize the tumor grade rather than the anatomical origin .</sentence>
<sentence> In practice , those tumors termed well or intermediately differentiated PanNETs in the WHO scheme are sometimes called islet cell tumors .</sentence>
<sentence> Paratyphoid fever , also known simply as paratyphoid , is a bacterial infection caused by one of the three types of Salmonella enterica .</sentence>

<sentence> Often there is a gradual onset of a high fever over several days .</sentence>
<sentence> Weakness , loss of appetite , and headaches also commonly occur .</sentence>
<sentence> Some people develop a skin rash with rose colored spots .</sentence>
<sentence> Without treatment symptoms may last weeks or months .</sentence>
<sentence> Other people may carry the bacteria without being affected ; however , are still able to spread the disease to others .</sentence>
<sentence> Both typhoid and paratyphoid are of similar severity .</sentence>
<sentence> Paratyphoid fever is a type of enteric fever along with typhoid fever .</sentence>
<sentence> Paratyphoid is caused by the bacteria Salmonella enterica of the serotype Paratyphi A , Paratyphi B or Paratyphi C growing in the intestines and blood .</sentence>
<sentence> Psittacosis -- also known as parrot fever , and ornithosis -- is a zoonotic infectious disease caused by a bacterium called Chlamydophila psittaci and contracted from infected parrots , such as macaws , cockatiels and budgerigars , and pigeons , sparrows , ducks , hens , gulls and many other species of bird .</sentence>
<sentence> The incidence of infection in canaries and finches is believed to be lower than in psittacine birds .</sentence>
<sentence> In certain contexts , the word psittacosis is used when the disease is carried by any species of bird belonging to the Psittacidae family , whereas ornithosis is used when other birds carry the disease .</sentence>
<sentence> In humansIn humans , after an incubation period of 5 -- 19 days , the symptoms of the disease range from<morphneg>inapparent</morphneg>  illness to systemic illness with severe pneumonia .</sentence>
<sentence> It presents chiefly as an<morphneg>atypical</morphneg>  pneumonia .</sentence>
<sentence> In the first week of psittacosis the symptoms mimic typhoid fever : prostrating high fevers , joint pains , diarrhea , conjunctivitis , nose bleeds and low level of white blood cells in the blood .</sentence>
<sentence> Rose spots can appear and these are called Horder 's spots .</sentence>

<sentence> Rashes may cause the skin to change color , itch , become warm , bumpy , dry , cracked or blistered , swell and may be painful .</sentence>
<sentence> The causes , and therefore treatments for rashes , vary widely .</sentence>
<sentence> Diagnosis must take into account such things as the appearance of the rash , other symptoms , what the patient may have been exposed to , occupation , and occurrence in family members .</sentence>
<sentence> The diagnosis may confirm any number of conditions .</sentence>
<sentence> The presence of a rash may aid associated signs and symptoms are diagnostic of certain diseases .</sentence>
<sentence> For example , the rash in measles is an erythematous , maculopapular rash that begins a few days after the fever starts ; it classically starts at the head and spreads downwards .</sentence>
<sentence> Common causes of rashes include :<morphneg>Uncommon</morphneg>  causes : Evaluating a rash The causes of a rash are extremely broad , which may make the evaluation of a rash extremely difficult .</sentence>

<sentence> This can be caused by a heart attack in which the heart 's demand for oxygen is<sentneg>not</sentneg>  met and the heart muscle begins to die .</sentence>
<sentence> The sudden failure of normal circulation of blood due to failure of the heart to contract results in the body<sentneg>not</sentneg>  getting enough oxygenated blood .</sentence>
<sentence> This causes cells to start to die from oxygen starvation .</sentence>
<sentence> Cerebral hypoxia -LRB- lack of oxygen to the brain -RRB- makes a person lose consciousness and<sentneg>stop</sentneg>  breathing , and this makes the heart<sentneg>stop</sentneg>  completely .</sentence>
<sentence> Unless the person is in hypothermia , brain damage usually occurs after three to five minutes .</sentence>
<sentence> In some cases , the person is put into hypothermia on purpose , to help the person recover better with less damage .</sentence>
<sentence> Cardiac arrest is a medical emergency .</sentence>
<sentence> If it is treated early enough , some of the damage done can be reversed in certain groups of patients .</sentence>
<sentence> When cardiac arrest leads to a person 's death , this is called sudden cardiac death -LRB- SCD -RRB- .</sentence>
<sentence> Chickenpox -LRB- or chicken pox -RRB- is a disease .</sentence>
<sentence> Usually it is children who get the disease , but adults can also get it -LRB- though its usually shingles they get -RRB- .</sentence>

<sentence> Estimates are that in the United States between five and nine percent of schoolchildren have dyslexia , though estimates go as high as fifty percent .</sentence>
<sentence> A person can have dyslexia even if he or she is very smart or educated .</sentence>
<sentence> Recent studies show that there are many small business owners that have dyslexia ; between 35 and 50 percent of U.S. and British entrepreneurs are affected .</sentence>
<sentence> Researchers think that many dyslexic entrepreneurs are successful because they can delegate responsibilities -LRB- of writing letters -RRB- and still be good at speaking .</sentence>
<sentence> At the end of the 20th century , scientists did a lot of research about dyslexia and found some of the reasons that people are dyslexic .</sentence>
<sentence> A professor who did research in the 1980s and 1990s looked at the brains of dyslexic people who had died .</sentence>
<sentence> He found that some parts of the brain were<sentneg>not</sentneg>  connected very well , and that this happened during the fourth month of pregnancy .</sentence>
<sentence> This problem has a big effect on the left half of the brain .</sentence>
<sentence> Encephalopathy means disease of the brain .</sentence>

<sentence> Food poisoning is when someone gets sick from eating food or drink that has gone bad or is contaminated .</sentence>
<sentence> There are two kinds of food poisoning : poisoning by toxic agent or by infectious agent .</sentence>
<sentence> Food infection is when the food contains bacteria or other microbes which infect the body after it is eaten .</sentence>
<sentence> Food intoxication is when the food contains toxins , including bacterially produced exotoxins , which can happen even when the microbe that produced the toxin is<sentneg>no</sentneg>  longer present or able to cause infection .</sentence>
<sentence> Even though it is commonly called food poisoning , most cases are caused by a variety of pathogenic bacteria , viruses , prions or parasites that contaminate food , rather than chemical or natural toxins which are what we usually call poison .</sentence>
<sentence> According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , about 76 million people in the United States become ill from the food they eat , and about 5,000 of them die every year .</sentence>

<sentence> Generally , if a person 's blood pressure stays at 140/90 torr -LRB- a unit of pressure -RRB- or above in both arms , that person has high blood pressure .</sentence>
<sentence> A recent report has defined blood pressure 120/80 torr to 139/89 torr as prehypertension .</sentence>
<sentence> Prehypertension is<sentneg>not</sentneg>  a disease , but means that a person has a high risk of developing hypertension .</sentence>
<sentence> In patients with diabetes mellitus or kidney disease , studies have shown that blood pressure over 130/80 torr should be considered a risk factor and may need treatment .</sentence>
<sentence> A number of factors increase the risk of developing hypertension , including high salt use , being overweight , occupation , drinking alcohol , family size , excessive noise and crowding .</sentence>
<sentence> High salt use has received the greatest attention .</sentence>
<sentence> Aproximately 60 % of the hypertension patients are affected by salt use .</sentence>
